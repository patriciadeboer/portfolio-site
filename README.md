My name is **Patricia de Boer** and I am a **Software Engineer** (former Product Manager). I have a passion for continuously learning, hence why I decided to become a software engineer. I love building and designing applications and love the idea of coding daily! This site is to capture a bit about me and some of my projects past and present.
